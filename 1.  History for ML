BASICS THAT ARE NEEDED TO BE KNOWN:

First before starting python lets understand concept why we are learning Machine Leaning and what are its basic

Data:
1. In ML we usually deal with data
2. Place where we store data is called database.
3. Data is of different types
     1. Structured  - SQL DB/RDBMS/SQL Server/Tera Data
     2. Unstructured -MongoDB , Cassandra, DynamoDB ,Redis
     3. Semi- Structured

We need to know SQL to know Structured data
We need to learn json language for Unstructured data.

Data Science :
Getting data from different sources and extracting meaningfull information from data is called data science.

Artificial Intelligence: Build Machines that are intelligent to mimic human behaviour.
Example: You went to kitchen then you see hot soup you dont know thats hot and you touch then skin will burn , now next time wont do it you will learn from your mistakes.
Example: When you buy a plot we make plan this plan is called the AI.

They are three types of AI
1. Artificial Nano Intelligence
      When machine performs what human tells.
2. Artificial General Intelligence
      When a machine behaves like human.
      Need human to develop machines but after that they will do they work as humans.
3. Artificial Super Intelligence
      When a machine thinks scenarios where humans cant think. This technology is not yet present.
      Here machine will create machines and they can upgrade, research and perform tasks.
      This technology can make things easier for humans as well as they can destroy the humans if they feel treat.

Machine Learning :
Execution of plan in AI is Machine Learning.

Deep Learning :
It higher model of machine learning is Deep learning.

People say in Data science we get AI and in AI we get Machine learning and in Machine learning we get Deep learning.

In 2001 Williams Claimline he used data science was used as word in his research.
Without data we cannot develop intelligent machines but rate at which data is generated is maximized from 2001 , eventhough AI,MLand DL were developed before 2001 but 
after 2001 due to data increse, then trains machines started.
