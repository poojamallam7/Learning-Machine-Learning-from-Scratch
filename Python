BASICS THAT ARE NEEDED TO BE KNOWN:

First before starting python lets understand concept why we are learning Machine Leaning and what are its basic

Data:
1. In ML we usually deal with data
2.Place where we store data is called database.
3. Data is of different types
     1. Structured  - SQL DB/RDBMS/SQL Server/Tera Data
     2. Unstructured -MongoDB , Cassandra, DynamoDB ,Redis
     3. Semi- Structured

We need to know SQL to know Structured data
We need to learn json language for Unstructured data.

Data Science :
Getting data from different sources and extracting meaningfull information from data is called data science.

Artificial Intelligence: Build Machines that are intelligent to mimic human behaviour.
Example: You went to kitchen then you see hot soup you dont know thats hot and you touch then skin will burn , now next time wont do it you will learn from your mistakes.
Example: When you buy a plot we make plan this plan is called the AI.

They are three types of AI
1. Artificial Nano Intelligence
2. Artificial Super Intelligence
3.
